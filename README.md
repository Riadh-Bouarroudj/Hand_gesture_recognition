# Hand_gesture_recognition
# Description and explanation
This project presents a deep learning-driven approach for hand gesture recognition using wearable vision sensors, designed for interactive virtual museum environments. The classification task consists of recognizing seven distinct hand gestures: Like, Dislike, Ok, Point, Take picture, Slide right, and Slide left. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using the Interactive Museum for Gesture Recognition Dataset:   http://imagelab.ing.unimore.it/files/ego_virtualmuseum.zip

I initially implemented a basic solution using classical machine learning techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest. However, the observed performance was not satisfactory, with an accuracy of around 76%. To enhance classification accuracy, I developed a deep learning solution utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This approach improved accuracy to 86%, which was better than the classical methods but still unsatisfactory. Finally, I implemented a solution combining CNN for feature extraction with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for classification. This approach achieved the best results so far, with accuracy exceeding 99%.

# Structure and important details
- The files "Classic_Techniques.ipynb" and "Deep_Learning_Techniques.ipynb" contain the source code used for constructing, training, and evaluating the classic and deep learning techniques using Google Collab.
- To enhance user experience, I added the "Virtual_museum.py" file which provides a user interface representing a virtual museum. Here, users can navigate through the museum and perform the seven hand gestures by either passing videos or using an embedded camera, ideally positioned around the shoulder area.
- It's important to note that the "files" folder contains all necessary resources, including model weights, the user interface, the database, etc. To connect to an already created user, use admin admin.
